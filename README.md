This is a webgame using websockets to implement multiplayer.

Players cannot jump high enough to reach new paltforms and so will have to work as a team to jump higher. Each new platform reached will change the appearence of a player.

Programmed using the Phaser.io game engine.

Use an nginx server to serve files and let the server focus on broadcasting players data.
