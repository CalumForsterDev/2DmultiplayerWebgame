This is a webgame using websockets to implement multiplayer.

Players cannot jump high enough to reach new paltforms and so will have to work as a team to jump higher. Each new platform reached will change the appearence of a player.

Programmed using the Phaser.io game engine.

Use an nginx server to serve files and let the server focus on broadcasting players data.

TODO:

	add voice chat
	add a way to add your face


The webserver is Node.js so to run the game you need to install Nodejs and then run the index.js file
